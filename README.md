# JamesBot
A Python-powered, story-tweeting TwitterBot.

Note: This code is rather hacky. It worked (for the most part) when I initially made it. However, I was encountering issues with the Twitter API's limits. Because I have not recently attempted to use this, I can make no guarantee about its usability.
